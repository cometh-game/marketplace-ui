## Setting Up Your Project

### 1. Initial Setup:

First, install the required dependencies and start application.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the application
yarn dev
```


### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
Environment variables are typed in `env.ts` and defined in the `.env` file. Ensure the **`.env`** file is correctly defined during both build and runtime."

Based on the provided `.env.example`, here's an example of how your `.env` file should look:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZERO_EX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Cometh
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMETH_MARKETPLACE_API_URL="https://api.marketplace.prod.core.cometh.tech/v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMETH_CONNECT_API_KEY=<API_KEY> // optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```
Â 
ðŸ”§ Please replace `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_API_KEY` with the appropriate Zero Ex contract address.
The **NEXT_PUBLIC_COMETH_MARKETPLACE_API_URL** is set by default and shouldn't be changed unless otherwise noted.
ðŸ‘‰ To add *Cometh Connect* in your marketplace, you need to generate an API key here: [Cometh Connect](https://docs.cometh.io/connect/quickstart/getting-started).

### 3. Customizing Your Marketplace

#### **Manifest:**Â 
Use the `manifest.ts` file to configure essential aspects of your marketplace. It lets you set:
- The name of your marketplace.
- Contract addresses.
- Asset attribute configurations.
- Network details.
- Currency settings.

ðŸ”§ **Important:** It's crucial to customize the `manifest.ts` file to align with the specifics of your marketplace.

#### **Global configuration:**
You can manage the configuration of your site directly from the `site.ts` file. This allows you to update site name, metadatas and links.

```
import { manifest } from "@/manifests"

export type SiteConfig = typeof siteConfig

export const siteConfig = {
  name: `${manifest.name} | Marketplace`,
  description: `Discover ${manifest.name}, the ultimate Web3 marketplace platform.`,
  mainNav: [
    {
      title: "Home", 
      href: "/",
    },
    {
      title: "Marketplace",
      href: "/marketplace",
    },
  ],
}
```

#### **Theming:**
The appearance of your marketplace is fully customizable via the provided CSS file. Customize the `styles/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js` files to define colors, fonts, etc.
